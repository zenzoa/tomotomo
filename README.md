- Double-click if you're sure a cell is unmarked
- Click the 'guess' button to make guesses instead of marks

There's a pixel design hidden within the grid... but how do you find it?

The hints you need are in the numbers next to each row and column. Each number represents a sequence of consecutive marked cells. (The sequences are in order, and there's got to be at least one empty space in between sequences.)

For example, a hint of 1-2-3 means there's 1 marked cell, followed by one or more empty spaces, 2 cells, some empty spaces, and then 3 cells. There might also be some empty cells before and after these sequences. The hard part is figuring out where exactly these sequences fit. You do this by making deductions and finding the places where there must (or mustn't) be marked cells based on the way hints in the rows and columns intersect. [The wikipedia entry for nonograms has a lot of strategies.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nonogram)
